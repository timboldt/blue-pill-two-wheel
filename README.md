# blue-pill-two-wheel

This is a reimplementation of my original Arduino-based bot, this time using STM32CubeMX and plain C.

Originally, this was a two-wheel balancing bot, but after a few iterations of that (in Arduino, CubeMX and finally [rusty-two-wheel](https://github.com/timboldt/rusty-two-wheel), implemented in Rust), I decided to evolve this into a standard two-wheel differential drive platform that I could do other experiments with.
